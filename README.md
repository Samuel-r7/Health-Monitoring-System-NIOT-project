# Internship - Arduino C

This repository contains the code and resources developed during my internship at the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT).
The project involved constructing a prototype embedded system for an underwater suit using ESP32 microcontrollers, various sensors, and LED displays to monitor the vital signs of the suit's user during deep-sea exploration. 
A server was hosted using XAMPP to provide a web interface for real-time data access across the network, utilizing a master-slave configuration of ESP32s for seamless device communication and control.
#The code files in this repository demonstrate the various functionalities implemented for real-time health data collection, communication protocols, and data display.
